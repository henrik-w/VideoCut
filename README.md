# VideoCut
This software is an example of a video editing application where I can learn Swift and SwiftUI.

My original intention was to create an adequate replacement tool for [MPEG Streamclip](http://www.squared5.com/svideo/mpeg-streamclip-mac.html), which is no longer executable since macOS 10.15 (a.k.a Catalina).  
Unfortunately, the program, which I really like and which has worked very well so far, has not been maintained since its last beta release on 20/08/2012. Unfortunately the source code has not been published either.
